## 💡 Project Overview

**"From Solo Project to Core Business Model"**

CameraFi Studio is a web platform that allows users to apply overlays, such as scoreboards and subtitles, to sports matches or broadcast feeds.
Starting as a **solo developer, I designed the frontend architecture from scratch** and grew the project into the company's second main revenue stream.

Targeting a global market, I implemented **Internationalization (i18n)** and an **Integrated Payment System (Paddle)**, and improved web application performance through **Webpack configuration optimization**.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **Styling:** MUI (Material UI) + Styled-components
- **Infrastructure:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
- **Payment:** Paddle
- **Optimization:** Webpack, Bundle Analyzer

## 💻 Key Technical Challenges

### 1. 15% Bundle Size Reduction (324KB → 277KB)

<ImageDescription src="/images/camerafi-studio/optimization_chart.webp" alt="Bundle size reduction chart">
  Led the <strong>optimization of Webpack configurations</strong> to improve initial loading speed.
</ImageDescription>

1. **Tree Shaking:** Reduced build size by removing unused modules from heavy libraries like `lodash`.
2. **Dynamic Import:** Changed heavy components not needed for initial entry (e.g., charts, modals) to load asynchronously.

Through this, I **reduced the main bundle size by approximately 15% (47KB)**, significantly shortening the TTI (Time to Interactive).

### 2. Secure Integrated Authentication System

Rather than relying solely on libraries, I designed a secure login process combining **Firebase Custom Tokens** and **Cookies**.

I enhanced security by synchronizing the authentication state between client and server via cookies and built a separate **Integrated Login Page** to establish a foundation for Single Sign-On (SSO) across future services.

### 3. Scalable Global Architecture

I adopted an **i18n** system from the early stages to support global users.

Additionally, I combined **MUI** and **Styled-components** to build a **Global Theme System**. This created a flexible UI structure capable of adapting to design requirement changes, such as brand color updates or Dark Mode implementation.

### 4. Custom Compliance Implementation (Cookie Consent)

To comply with global web standards like GDPR without relying on third-party tools, I **developed the Cookie Consent banner and control logic from scratch**.

By implementing this directly, I prevented page speed degradation caused by loading unnecessary external scripts.

## 💬 Retrospective: "From Solo Developer to Architect"

### 1. Initial Design Considering Scalability

I was wary that a poor initial structure in a solo project could lead to unmanageable technical debt later.

Instead of rushing feature implementation, I strictly adhered to **Next.js** folder structure principles and applied strong **TypeScript** typing. I focused on building a **solid codebase** that would remain robust even as the team expanded.

### 2. Experience with Monetization (Paddle)

I gained experience in building a **'revenue-generating service'** beyond simple feature development.

By integrating the **Paddle** payment module, I developed a deep understanding of the entire payment lifecycle, including subscription state management and renewal processing via Webhooks.
