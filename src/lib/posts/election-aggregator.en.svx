## 💡 Project Overview

**"What if scattered election information was gathered in one place?"**

During the election period, information such as news, polls, and candidate pledges was scattered across various platforms, making it difficult for voters to access. To solve this, I developed an **Aggregator Service that collects and visualizes all election-related data**.

I adopted **AWS Amplify (Serverless)** to efficiently build Authentication and Backend APIs, and utilized **MUI (Material UI)** and **Recharts** to implement an intuitive dashboard UI.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Styled Components, MUI (Material UI)
- **Visualization:** Recharts
- **Backend (Serverless):** AWS Amplify (Auth, API)
- **Crawling & Network:** Cheerio, Microlink, Axios

## 💻 Key Features

### 1. Main Dashboard UI

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/1.webp" alt="Main page"/>

The first dashboard users encounter.

Utilizing **MUI's Grid System**, I organized the D-Day counter, daily headlines, and election timeline into a responsive layout.

### 2. AWS Amplify-based Authentication

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/2.webp" alt="Login page"/>

Integrated **AWS Amplify Auth** to implement secure sign-up and login session management without the overhead of building a separate backend server.

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/3.webp" alt="Signup page"/>

Implemented custom login and sign-up modals to provide a seamless user experience.

### 3. Personalization (Bookmarks)

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/5.webp" alt="Reading list"/>

Users can bookmark articles of interest, which are synchronized to their personal storage via **Amplify API (GraphQL)**.

### 4. News Curation & Visualization

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/11.webp" alt="Election news page"/>

Displays processed data collected via Naver News API in card format.

Enhanced information delivery by visualizing metadata (thumbnails, summaries) using **Microlink**.

### 5. Poll Charts

<ImageDescription src="/images/election-aggregator/13.webp" alt="Election poll page"/>

Visualized complex approval rating trends into intuitive line and bar charts using the **Recharts** library.

## 🧑‍💻 Role (Team Leader & Full Stack)

**Led initial environment setup, AWS infrastructure integration, and core frontend development.**

- **Tech Lead:** Established ESLint/Prettier conventions and introduced Git Flow strategy.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Built Authentication (Cognito) and Data (AppSync) communication environments using AWS Amplify.
- **Frontend Development:**
  - Implemented data visualization components using **Recharts**.
  - Designed a consistent UI system based on **MUI & Styled Components**.
  - Resolved CORS issues and integrated APIs using Axios and Proxy settings.

## 💬 Retrospective: "Exploring the Potential of Serverless Architecture"

### Productivity with AWS Amplify

By adopting **AWS Amplify** instead of building complex backend infrastructure, I created an environment where I could focus on business logic and data visualization. This allowed me to deploy a complete service featuring Auth, DB, and API within a limited project timeframe.
