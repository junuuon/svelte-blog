## 💡 Project Overview

**"Adding the flexibility of dynamic routing to the performance of a static site"**

Traditional static hosting like GitHub Pages cannot execute server-side logic, forcing developers to rely on client-side scripts for tasks like localization.

I migrated this project to **Cloudflare Pages** to adopt a **Hybrid Strategy**: maintaining the fast performance of **SSG (Static Site Generation)** while utilizing **Edge Functions (Middleware)** to detect user language at the request level.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Svelte 5, SvelteKit (Adapter Cloudflare)
- **Infrastructure:** Cloudflare Pages (Functions)
- **Styling:** Pure CSS (CSS Variables)
- **Content:** Mdsvex

## 💻 Key Features

### 1. Hybrid UX (Resume + Portfolio)

<ImageDescription src="/images/sveltekit-portfolio/1.webp" alt="Main page" />

Combined the information density of a Resume with the visual experience of a Portfolio.
The home screen is designed as a **'Resume'** to deliver core information quickly, while clicking 'View Details' transitions to a **'Project Retrospective'** page.

### 2. Server-side Language Detection

```typescript
export const handle: Handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  let locale = event.cookies.get(LANGUAGE_COOKIE) as 'ko' | 'en' | undefined;

  if (!locale) {
    const acceptLanguage = event.request.headers.get('accept-language');
    locale = detectLanguageFromHeader(acceptLanguage);
  }

  event.locals.locale = locale;

  const response = await resolve(event, {
    transformPageChunk: ({ html }) => html.replace('%lang%', locale),
  });

  return response;
};
```

Solved the 'screen flickering' issue common with client-side (`navigator.language`) detection.

By utilizing **Cloudflare Functions**, the app parses the `Accept-Language` header on the server side. This ensures the HTML is rendered in the user's preferred language (English/Korean) before it even reaches the browser.

### 3. Web Standards & Performance Optimization

<ImageDescription src="/images/sveltekit-portfolio/3.webp" alt="Lighthouse performance score" />

Achieved **Performance 97, Accessibility/Best Practices 100**.

Search engine indexing (SEO) was intentionally blocked (`robots.txt`) for privacy reasons, but all other aspects strictly adhere to web standards through semantic markup and image optimization.

### 4. Pure CSS Responsive Design

<ImageDescription src="/images/sveltekit-portfolio/2.webp" alt="Responsive design demo"/>

Designed a responsive layout using Pure CSS without heavy CSS frameworks.

Beyond simple resizing, I implemented optimized UI/UX for both **Mobile and PC** environments to ensure clear information delivery across all devices.

## 💬 Technical Decisions

### 1. Why migrate from GitHub Pages to Cloudflare Pages?

The biggest reason was the **Initial Load Experience**. To serve localized pages on static hosting like GitHub Pages, the browser must load a blank page, check the language via JavaScript, and then redirect. I considered this micro-flickering and delay detrimental to the user experience.

By intercepting requests via **Cloudflare Functions**, I could provide a **perfectly rendered first screen** without any delay.

### 2. Transition from Next.js to Svelte

Static exports in Next.js still incur Hydration overhead due to the React runtime. I judged this to be unnecessary for a content-focused portfolio site.

**Svelte** compiles components into optimized vanilla JS, resulting in a lighter runtime and faster First Contentful Paint (FCP), making it the most suitable tool for building a performance-centric static site.

### 3. SEO Score and Privacy

The SEO score of 66 on Lighthouse is an intentional design choice, not a technical flaw. To prevent sensitive personal information included in the resume from being indiscriminately exposed to search engines, I applied `noindex`. This decision prioritizes security and privacy.
